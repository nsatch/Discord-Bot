# Technically speaking iterating through all the lines and storing them into a list then randomly selecting one element has horrible run time and memory consumption
# but this is all just small text which is small in memory and the lists won't be very long given how many people will use the bot in my context, so this method is
# fine for that purpose. 
# If I was truly concerned about runtime, I would reserve the first line for storing how many lines are in the file as an int, then only read that line and generate 
# a random number between 1 and that number. I would then return the quote from the random line number generated. Going to that specific line though without iteration
# is not something I am sure is possible though with Pythons tools (I really haven't investigated this implementation at all). At the very least, you could iterate thru
# the list this way without storing each read line in a list like I do above which would at least reduce memory consumption (again like what a few kb though?)

# ^^^^^^ COMMENTS ON THE EFFICENCY OF QUOTE SEARCHING THRU THE ABOVE METHOD ^^^^^^^
# All,
# As my kiddos are off from school, I am also stuck in my domicile on this lovely day. I can already hear the chorus of cheers all way from here at the reception of the aforementioned announcement.
# To follow this up, please take some time to read/look through the following sections in your Tro book to keep us on task for Wednesday:13.1-13.5.
# Keep in mind that on Thurs. we will be doing a lab which requires a laboratory procedure as we have not provided one for you. Please take this extra time to also think about how you are planning on performing this lab. 
# Everyone stay safe and I will see you on Wed!
# Dr. Dan
